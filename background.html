        Hi, this is Seven. I am a yoga teacher and a student of yoga from India. I was born in a traditional Hindu family which helped me understand the basics of yoga philosophy from a very young age. I am also a university graduate, and upon finishing my studies, I worked for many multinational companies and had a successful career. However, I quit my high paying corporate career in pursuit of learning yoga. After that, I traveled to many spiritually energetic places in India and decided to study and practice yoga full time.<br><br>

 I spent more than a year learning and teaching yoga in Rishikesh, India. I also went to Mysore in South India, where I was learning Ashtanga yoga from Sharath Jois at KPJAYI – the main school of Ashtanga yoga asana system. Then I moved to Goa and founded “Ganeshala yoga school” where I and a few more yoga teachers selected were teaching different styles of yoga. However, due to covid restrictions. I shifted to teaching yoga online and giving private classes upon request. In my experience of teaching yoga to many working professionals, I have personally seen how regular yoga practice can magically transform one’s life! <br><br>

 I am not only a yoga asana practitioner but also a student of yoga philosophy. As a student, I have spent a lot of time learning many yoga scriptures like Bhagavad Gita, Pathanjali yoga sutras, Advaita Vedanta (non duality), Sankhya philosophy. And I am more than willing to share this philosophy knowledge to more serious yoga students. <br><br>

 I am also a motorcycle adventurer, having spent many months on solo motorcycle journeys in the great Himalayan mountains, in high altitude remote villages. I believe my life transformed significantly during my himalayan travels, where I spent quite a lot of lone time in introspection (Swadhyaya). My other hobbies include photography, percussion instruments, and listening to podcasts!
